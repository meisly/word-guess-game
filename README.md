# Smoosh's Adventures in the Big City

Enjoy this thrilling browser game that isn't just a cheesy hangman clone.  Help Smoosh, the world's cattiest cat find his way home using the powers of phonics...or sight reading.  I dunno.  One of those.  Feel free to use any psionic powers you may possess or just randomly mash buttons.  These are all good strategies.  If you want to see the cat die try hitting the down arrow.  That's not creepy.  It was for science or testing or something.  I swear.
